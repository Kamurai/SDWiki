Soon, Tazak was sending unprecedented amounts of double-dollars back to his people and had resigned himself to this new life as a bandit. While the pair work well together, they will just as often go off on separate capers. Double the jobs means double the loot, and Tazak needs to do all he can to help his tribe.'
