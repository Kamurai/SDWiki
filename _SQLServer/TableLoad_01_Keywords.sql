Area effects have a special set of\r\nrules to govern how they function:\r\n* First determine which models are in the squares that will be\r\naffected by the area effect. This will vary depending on the\r\ntype of area effect being used.\r\n• Burst X requires that you select a single model, in line of sight\r\nto the model using the effect, as the action’s target. The area\r\neffect is centered on that target.\r\n• Cross X, Wave X, and Aura X are centered on the user. In this\r\ncase the user is considered the target but it is not affected by\r\nits own area effect unless the effect states otherwise (such as\r\nin the case of Augment).\r\n•Lance X, Spray X, and Sweep X require that you choose one\r\nsquare that is adjacent (but not diagonal) to the model using\r\nthe effect. Then determine the remaining squares affected\r\nfrom the initial square chosen, using the area effect’s rules\r\nand diagrams as a guide. Unlike other effects the initial square\r\nchosen may be empty.\r\n• If the area effect is part of an attack, make a single attack roll\r\nand apply it to every model affected. Each model affected\r\nmakes their own defense roll, comparing their result to the\r\nattack roll separately.\r\n• All models affects by an area effect are considered to be hit\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n• Friendly models, including the user, are not affected by area\r\neffects unless the area effect specifies otherwise (such as in\r\nthe case of Augment).\r\n• Area effects do not affect squares that the user cannot draw\r\nline of sight to unless the area effect specifies otherwise.\r\n• Some area effects cover a different area if the model using\r\nthem is on a large base. When this is the case, use the example\r\ndiagram as a guide.\r\n• If a model is affected by two area effects simultaneously the\r\neffects are cumaltive as long as the abilities are different --\r\neven if their effects are the same.\r\n• Some area effects replace the distance portion of a model’s\r\nspecial ability ie Magic X, Missile X, or Range X. In this case\r\nignore the ‘X’ portion of the ability that allows them to target\r\ndistant models and replace it with the area effect.
