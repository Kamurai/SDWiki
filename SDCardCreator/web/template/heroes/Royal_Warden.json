It is the duty of the Royal Wardens to maintain the King's peace along the roads, trails, and wilderness that bind the kingdom together. These rugged and hardy individuals travel the realms fighting brigands, tracking down fugitives, and collecting the Kings taxes. Hailed as both Hero and Villain, there are few servants of the kingdom as iconic as the doughty warden.",
